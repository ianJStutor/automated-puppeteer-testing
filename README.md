# Automated Puppeteer Testing

## Description

Part of Google's Web Fundamentals course intended for publication to web.dev, this is custom code for a tutorial demo using Google's Puppeteer. The tutorial introduces learners to the benefits and importance of automated website testing and guides them through the JavaScript and Node.js commands needed for this project.

The only dependency is the <code>puppeteer</code> Node module. All other project needs were written from scratch. The project code base includes the following:
* Customized testing functionality and test runner module
* Highly customized http server
* Customized watch file system
* Demo scheduler app (Gourmet Coffee Tasting) with deliberate errors to be discovered through the tutorial and automated testing
